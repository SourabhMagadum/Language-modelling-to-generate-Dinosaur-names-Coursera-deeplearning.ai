By completing this assignment I learnt:
- How to store text data for processing using an RNN.
- How to synthesize data, by sampling predictions at each time step and passing it to the next RNN-cell unit.
- How to build a character-level text generation recurrent neural network.
- Why clipping the gradients is important.
